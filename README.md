# Gatling Load Testing for eCommerce Application

This repository contains load testing projects for an eCommerce application using Gatling. It showcases examples in both Java (using Maven), Javascript (using NPM), and  TypeScript (using NPM). The application under test is hosted at [https://ecomm.gatling.io](https://ecomm.gatling.io).

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use Gatling for load testing an eCommerce application, providing examples in two languages:

- Java with Maven: Leverages the Gatling Maven Plugin for executing load tests.
- Javascript with NPM: Utilizes Gatling JS for scripting and running load tests in Javascript.
- TypeScript with NPM: Utilizes Gatling JS for scripting and running load tests in TypeScript.
- Scala with SBT: Leverages the Gatling SBT Plugin for executing load tests.

## Project Structure

- `/java`: Contains the Java project setup for load testing using Maven. See the Java README for details on setup and execution.
- `/javascript`: Contains the Javascript project setup for load testing using Gatling JS. See the Javascript README for instructions on prerequisites and usage.
- `/typescript`: Contains the TypeScript project setup for load testing using Gatling JS. See the TypeScript README for instructions on prerequisites and usage.
- - `/scala`: Contains the Scala project setup for load testing using SBT. See the Scala README for details on setup and execution.

## Application Under Test

The eCommerce application used for testing is hosted at [https://ecomm.gatling.io](https://ecomm.gatling.io). It serves as the target application for our load testing scenarios, simulating realistic user interactions.
